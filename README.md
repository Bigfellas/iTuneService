iTuneService
============

Runs iTunes as a Windows Service

iTuneService makes installing and launching iTunes as a Windows Service an easy process. Run under any user credentials and take advantage of all the usual Windows Service controls.

Running iTunes as a service means that iTunes will start before anyone even logs onto the computer. You can use the [Apple Remote App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/remote/id284417350) to play your music without logging in. Or you can easily share you library using [Home Sharing](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4620) on a headless server.
 
iTuneService was formerly known as JTunes and was originally created by John Cleary ([www.johncleary.net](http://www.johncleary.net)).

Also contributing to the project is Nathan Jones ([www.nathanpjones.com](http://www.nathanpjones.com)).
